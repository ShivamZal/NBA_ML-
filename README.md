<h1>Forecasting Home Team Wins or Losses Using ML Algorithms</h1>

<p>Welcome to an intriguing exploration into the realm of NBA game predictions! Our endeavor revolves around the fascinating intersection of data science and basketball, as we endeavor to unravel the enigma of forecasting whether the home team emerges victorious or succumbs to defeat.</p>

<h2>Algorithms and Libraries</h2>

<p>Embark on this journey armed with state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms including the formidable Random Forests, the discerning K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and the sophisticated Logistic Regression. Through the seamless integration of Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, NumPy, and MLxtend libraries, we unveil insights from the depths of NBA game data.</p>

<h2>Project Question</h2>

<p>Our quest is simple yet profound: Can historical data illuminate the path to predicting the outcome of NBA games? The saga unfolds across three meticulously crafted chapters:</p>
