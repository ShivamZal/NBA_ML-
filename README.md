<h1>Forecasting Home Team Wins or Losses Using ML Algorithms</h1>

<p>Welcome to an intriguing exploration into the realm of NBA game predictions! Our endeavor revolves around the fascinating intersection of data science and basketball, as we endeavor to unravel the enigma of forecasting whether the home team emerges victorious or succumbs to defeat.</p>

<h2>Algorithms and Libraries</h2>

<p>Embark on this journey armed with state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms including the formidable Random Forests, the discerning K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and the sophisticated Logistic Regression. Through the seamless integration of Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, NumPy, and MLxtend libraries, we unveil insights from the depths of NBA game data.</p>

<h2>Project Question</h2>

<p>Our quest is simple yet profound: Can historical data illuminate the path to predicting the outcome of NBA games? The saga unfolds across three meticulously crafted chapters:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Data Cleaning and EDA:</strong> Witness the transformation of raw data into a treasure trove of insights through meticulous cleansing and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). Delve into captivating visualizations, including mesmerizing comparisons of total points scored by year and the ebbs and flows of victories over time.</li>
  <li><strong>Merge:</strong> Enter a realm where disparate data converge to unveil hidden truths. Experience the synthesis of essential attributes such as city names, average capacity, and team identities, culminating in a comprehensive dataset poised for predictive analysis.</li>
  <li><strong>ML:</strong> Traverse the landscape of machine learning as we partition our dataset, fashioning training and testing sets with finesse. Immerse yourself in a symphony of statistical prowess, as we orchestrate the predictive power of variables ranging from points scored to defensive acumen. Behold the triumphant emergence of Logistic Regression, the champion of binary classification, amidst a backdrop of insightful confusion matrices.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Future Scope</h2>

<p>The canvas of possibilities stretches far and wide, beckoning towards a future ripe with innovation. Envision the integration of cutting-edge NBA statisticsâ€”efficacious metrics like effective field goal percentage (eFG%), the sublime true shooting percentage (TS%), and the intricate dynamics of player combinations. In this ever-evolving landscape, our journey continues as we strive to refine our predictive prowess and illuminate the path to organizational excellence.</p>
